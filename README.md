#ALang

Tiny interpreted language written Java and ANTLR 4

##Features
```
    #Alang is a dynamically typed language
    
    #Just give a name and a value and you are
    #ready to go.
    hello := "world"
    
    #Alang supports integers and strings
    y := 42
    
    #how to output things to console
    println("Quick and easy")
    
    #We have for loops with ranges
    # 1 .. 10 means from 1 to 10
    for(i := 0 .. 10) {
        println(i)
    }
    
    #Lists are made this way
    x := [3, 9, 4, 6, 5, 1, 6, 7, 8, 10, 2]
    
    #Lists are also dynamically typed
    #so you can have things like this
    
    x := ["Hello", 10]
